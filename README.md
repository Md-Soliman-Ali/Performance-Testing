# Performance-Testing

First, you need to download JMeter. After performance testing is done, save the JMX file into the apache-JMeter bin folder. For non-GUI mode run, you need to go to the apache-JMeter bin location using cmd & type ( JMeter -n -t file_name.jmx -l file_name.xml -e -o report ) 

[-n = It specifies JMeter is to run in non-GUI mode, -t = Name of JMX file that contains the Test Plan, -l = Name of JMeter text logs file to log results, -o = output]
